Well I guess this is it huh? Never thought this is how we would go out... I guess it's fitting if you really think about it. Everything we did to them, it finally caught up to us. You won't accept that huh? I figured as much from you, always thinking of the next move. I was hoping you would take the time to reflect here, but if you wan't to keep fighting, I snagged a key from the guard when he locked us in here. It's over in the corner, good luck...;
Oh! You made it! I was worried you would get trapped back there. I was able to find a hidden passage in the cell and it popped me out right here. Oh by the way, have you seen the chests around here? I was able to peek inside the ones over there, but I the armor in there wouldn't fit me. Give it a try! Hopefully I'll see you soon, I saw a crevice back there and I'm going to see where it leads. I'll meet up with you later.;
Hey, be careful! I think I saw a vampire on the other side of the wall. The count must have heard we escaped and sent one of his goons to look for us. You better grab the armor in that chest behind you, it's your only chance!;
Wow what a gross room. You should know, I was able to peek through a crack in the door into the next room, it looks like the barracks for his stone army. They must be guarding something or someone big. I think we're close!;
Hey make sure that you checked all the chests for the key! If you can't carry anymore potions, try drinking some to free up some inventory space!;
The Count really doesn't like whatever is in the chest in the corner, I think it might be able to hurt him!;
Wow you were able to finally take him down...What a shame, seems that now the only thing left to do is kill you, and take your fame for myself. Goodbye, Hunter....;
