This project came about as a test of coding skills in Java.
Jordan Spencer and Nicholas Moffit sought out to determine if it was possible to create a simple dungeon crawler game using the
basic coding structure learned in a data structures class.
This game proves that it is not only possible, but an excellent way to enhance those basic building blocks and 
develop coding principle and practices outside of understanding the structures of object oriented language.
