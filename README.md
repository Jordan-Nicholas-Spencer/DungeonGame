This project came about as a test of coding skills in Java.
Jordan Spencer and Nicholas Moffit sought out to determine if it was possible to create a simple dungeon crawler game using the basic coding structures learned in a data structures class.

This game is not optimized as our goal was to utilize as many different data structure types as possible to ensure our full understanding. We discovered through this project that spending time coding and implementing our ideas for the project was the best possible method for us to develop our fundamental coding principles and practices. Further, we were forced to learn new structures and coding practices in order to progress the game into the state that it is in today. 

We highly encourage any person beginning their coding journey to develop their skills by tackling any passion project. You will not only cement your current skills, but refine and enhance your abilites beyond your expectations.
